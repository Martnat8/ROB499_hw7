# ROB 499 Robot Software Frameworks â€“ HW7

This package contains HW7 for ROB 499 (Robotic Software Frameworks) at Oregon State University.

It includes two ROS 2 nodes that take in a PointCloud2 message, detect the tabletop plane,
and republish:
- The points of the table
- The points above the table 
- A count of the clusters above the table

---

## Dependencies

This package requires **scikit-learn** and the **PCL library**.

Install them with:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
sudo apt install libpcl-dev ros-jazzy-pcl-conversions ros-jazzy-pcl-msgs
```

---

## Node Descriptions

- `clean_space`: A C++ node that uses the PCL library to segment the table and filter the point cloud.
- `cluster_finder`: A Python node that uses DBSCAN from scikit-learn to detect clusters above the table and publishes the cluster count.

---

## Usage

To play the bag file:

```bash
ros2 bag play drink_table
```

After unpacking, building, and sourcing the workspace, launch the nodes:

```bash
ros2 launch cluster_finder hw7launch.py
```
